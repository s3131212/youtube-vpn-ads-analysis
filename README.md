# VPN Advertisement Detection

This repository contains the code supporting our research on detecting advertisements in videos using large language models (LLMs). The project is organized into two main components:

## Project Structure

- **`video-download/`**: Tools for downloading YouTube videos and generating transcripts using OpenAI Whisper. This module helps gather and preprocess the video data needed for analysis.

- **`prompt-testing/`**: Code for designing, testing, and evaluating prompts that detect advertisements within the generated transcripts. This module interacts with LLMs via API calls.

Each directory includes its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions.

## Notes on Content Usage
- The information retrieved about videos (e.g., metadata, transcripts) remains the property of the original content creators.
- Any trademarks, logos, or brand names appearing in the video content or transcripts are the property of their respective owners. They are used here strictly for research purposes and not for commercial use.
